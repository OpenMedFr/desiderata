# Open Medieval French

The Open Medieval French (OpenMedFr) initiative aims to publish open, plain text versions of works written over four centuries of Medieval French writing. The main goal of the initiative in its early stages is to jump start digital textual studies in medieval French through the creation of open corpora and a community of both users and producers of textual data.

With such plain text versions at their disposal, researchers can use the texts within the scope of their advanced research questions (digital editions in TEI XML, text mining, NLP, alignment, entity extraction, etc.).

We work with digitized copies of a public domain books, process them by optical character recognition (OCR) and correct and annotate them by hand. In this first phase, the texts will be clean, but they will not be 100% error free.

An obvious place for us to begin is with the [Société des anciens textes français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_anciens_textes_fran%C3%A7ais), a series which contains some 90+ texts published before the 1920s.

Some candidates from pre-1925 SATF volumes for inclusion:

* _Trois versions rimées de l'Évangile de Nicodème_ (1885, 1889) - in process
* _La fille du comte de Pontieu_ 13th and 15th versions (1922) - in process

There are also many other places to find public domain digitized editions: Google
Books, Gallica, Internet Archive and HathiTrust. In addition, early Romance journals
such as _Romania_ and _Romanische Forschungen_ are important sources as well.

There are also existing corpora of works in medieval French, BMF, LFA (Ottawa),
Nouveau Corpus d'Amsterdam, SRCMF, Classiques Garnier, ARTFL. We are compiling a
list of what these corpora already offer and will publish it here.

OpenMedFr is inspired by the OpenPhilology movement, including [Open Greek and Latin](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin), the [Open Islamic Texts Initiative](https://github.com/OpenITI) and [EEBO TCP](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/).
