The Open Medieval French initiative aims to publish open, plain text
versions of works written over four centuries of Medieval French.  In the
beginning this means texts deriving from a digitized copy of a book, processed
by OCR and then corrected.

With such plain text versions at their disposal, scholars can use the texts
within the scope of their advanced research questions (digital editions, text
mining, NLP, entity extraction, etc.).

An obvious place for us to begin is with the [Société des anciens textes français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_anciens_textes_fran%C3%A7ais) which contains some 90+ texts published before the 1920s that have already been digitized.

Some initial desiderata might be:

..* _Trois versions rimées de l'Évangile de Nicodème_ (1885, 1889)
..* _Merlin_ in 2 vols (1886)
..* _Le roman de Thèbes_ in 2 vols (1890)
..* Jean Froissart, _Meliador_ in 3 vols (1895)
..* _Florence de Rome_ in 2 vols (1907, 1909)
..* Benoît de Sainte-Maure, _Le roman de Troie_ in 6 vols (1909)
..* Gervais de Bus, _Le roman de Fauvel_ in 2 vols (1914, 1919)
..* _Miracles de Nostre Dame par personnages_ in 8 vols (1876-83)

There are also many places to find open, digitized editions to work with: Google
Books, Gallica, Internet Archive, HathiTrust.  Of course, there are other medieval
French corpora available: BMF, LFA (Ottawa), Anglo-Norman Hub Online. We are
compiling a list of what they already have and will publish it here.
