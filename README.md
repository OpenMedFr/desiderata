# Open Medieval French

The Open Medieval French (OpenMedFr) initiative aims to publish open, plain text
versions of works written over four centuries of Medieval French.  

Medieval French is far behind other languages in terms of open corpora available for use in digital humanities scholarship.

In the beginning of the OpenMedFr initiative we intend to work with digitized copies of a public domain books, process them by optical character recognition (OCR) and correct and annotate them by hand. They will not be 100% error free. 

With such plain text versions at their disposal, researchers can use the texts within the scope of their advanced research questions (digital editions, text mining, NLP, alignment, entity extraction, etc.).

An obvious place for us to begin is with the [Société des anciens textes français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_anciens_textes_fran%C3%A7ais), a series which contains some 90+ texts published before the 1920s.

Some initial candidates for inclusion might be:

* _Trois versions rimées de l'Évangile de Nicodème_ (1885, 1889) - in process
* _La fille du comte de Pontieu_ 13th and 15th versions (1922) - in process 
* Jean Renart, _Le Lai de l'ombre_ (1913) - in process
* _L'escoufle_ (1894)
* _Florence de Rome_ in 2 vols (1907, 1909)
* _Merlin_ in 2 vols (1886)
* Gervais de Bus, _Le roman de Fauvel_ in 2 vols (1914, 1919)
* _Le roman de Thèbes_ in 2 vols (1890)
* Jean Froissart, _Meliador_ in 3 vols (1895)
* _Florence de Rome_ in 2 vols (1907, 1909)
* _Miracles de Nostre Dame par personnages_ in 8 vols (1876-83)
* Benoît de Sainte-Maure, _Le roman de Troie_ in 6 vols (1909)


There are also many other places to find public domain digitized editions: Google
Books, Gallica, Internet Archive and HathiTrust. In addition, early Romance journals
such as _Romania_ and _Romanische Forschungen_ are important sources as well.

There are also existing corpora of works in medieval French, BMF, LFA (Ottawa),
Nouveau Corpus d'Amsterdam, SRCMF, Classiques Garnier, ARTFL. We are compiling a
list of what these corpora already offer and will publish it here.

OpenMedFr is inspired by the OpenPhilology movement, including [Open Greek and Latin](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin), the [Open Islamic Texts Initiative](https://github.com/OpenITI) and [EEBO TCP](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/).
